# ðŸ§ª CleanCity QA Project: Test Plan & Strategy

## 1. Objective
Plan and execute comprehensive testing for CleanCity - Waste Pickup Scheduler web application.

## 2. Scope
- Functional testing of authentication, scheduling, dashboard, and admin features.
- Non-functional testing: performance, accessibility, and compatibility.
- Testing on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- No backend testing (localStorage only).

## 3. Tools
- **Manual Testing:** Browser DevTools, localStorage inspection
- **Project Management:** Jira
- **Accessibility:** axe DevTools, WAVE
- **Performance:** 
- **Documentation:** Markdown in `tests/` folder, GitHub issues for bugs

## 4. Test Strategy

Test Strategy for the waste management platform involved creating epics on Jira (project management tool) theb mapping each to functional requirements (FRs) to ensure complete coverage and easy tracing of tets activities.
